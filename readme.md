LLRoundSwitch - Enhanced UISwitch replacement with ARC support
==============================================================

12-05-2011 v0.1 not-even-alpha : transposed DCRoundSwitch code<br />
12-12-2011 v0.2 Beta: Added demo project, fixed KnobLayer memory leaks - test away

This is a placeholder README which will be fleshed out once I get more done.

Short story: A new version of DCRoundSwitch with ARC and a Github repo I pay attention to.
